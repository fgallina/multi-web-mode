1. Introduction

   Multi Web Mode is a minor mode wich makes web editing in Emacs much
   easier.

   Basically what it does is select the appropiate major mode
   automatically when you move the point and also calculates the
   correct indentation of chunks according to the indentation of the
   most relevant major mode.

   Currently it is more focused to work on buffers which contain html,
   css, javascript and php, but adding other modes is really simple:
   you just need to add your own mode to the `mweb-tags'. You can do
   that by using M-x customize-group RET multi-web-mode and looking
   for the `mweb-tags' variable.

   All third packages were removed from the project repo (they were
   included with mweb previously), mainly because it is difficult to
   track new versions for everything and because it favoured the user
   lazyness to check the basic configuration :).

   The last multi-web-mode release which contained all packages was
   0.2.1. It is still available from here:

2. Requirements

   You don't need any special libraries to run this package. Just the

   with >= 23.0.60.

3. Installation

   To install Multi Web Mode you'll need to do something like this in
   your .emacs:

   (require 'multi-web-mode)
   (setq mweb-default-major-mode 'html-mode)
   (setq mweb-tags '((php-mode "<\\?php\\|<\\? \\|<\\?=" "\\?>")
                      (js-mode "<script +\\(type=\"text/javascript\"\\|language=\"javascript\"\\)[^>]*>" "</script>")
                      (css-mode "<style +type=\"text/css\"[^>]*>" "</style>")))
   (setq mweb-filename-extensions '("php" "htm" "html" "ctp" "phtml" "php4" "php5"))
   (multi-web-global-mode 1)

   Restart Emacs or use M-x load-file ~/.emacs.

4. Usage

   Multi Web Mode binds the following keystrokes:

   M-<f11> : Prompts the user to override the default major mode.

   M-<f12> : Prompts the user to override the calculated extra
   indentation. Useful when the automatic calculation is not good
   enough.
